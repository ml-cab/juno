**Session 26** — LoRA inference overlay (`--lora-play`), Q&A training mode (`/train-qa`), diagnostic tracing, and AWS deploy hardening.

### `--lora-play PATH` — apply trained adapters at inference in any mode

Pre-trained `.lora` checkpoint files can now be applied read-only at inference time without entering the `lora` REPL. Three modes are supported:

**`local` mode:**
```bash
./juno local --model-path model.gguf --lora-play /path/to/model.lora
```
`ConsoleMain.runLocalRepl()` calls `LoraAdapterSet.load(Path.of(loraPlayPath))` before building the shard handlers and passes the result into `ForwardPassHandlerLoader.load(..., playAdapters)`.

**`cluster` mode (forked JVMs):**
```bash
./juno --model-path model.gguf --lora-play /path/to/model.lora
```
`ClusterHarness.withLoraPlay(path)` injects `-Djuno.lora.play.path=PATH` into every forked node JVM command. `EmbeddedNodeServer.NodeServiceImpl` reads this property at construction and loads adapters inside `loadShard()` before the `ForwardPassHandlerLoader` call.

**AWS deployed cluster:**
```bash
./launcher.sh juno-deploy.sh setup --lora-play /absolute/path/to/model.lora
```
See AWS section below.

### `ForwardPassHandlerLoader` — new LoRA overload

```java
// New canonical overload — all others delegate to this
public static ForwardPassHandler load(
    Path modelPath, ShardContext context, MatVec backend,
    LoraAdapterSet adapters) throws IOException
```

When `adapters != null`, the loader routes to `LoraTrainableHandler` (inference-only, no optimizer attached) instead of the architecture-specific handler. When `adapters == null` the existing `phi3` / `llama` dispatch is unchanged. `selectBackend()` promoted from package-private to `public` so player-module callers can reuse it.

### `ClusterHarness` — `withLoraPlay()` fluent method

```java
harness.withLoraPlay("/path/to/model.lora");
```

Stores the path and injects `-Djuno.lora.play.path=PATH` into the `launchNode()` JVM command, after the JFR flags. Without this, forked node JVMs start with `loraPlayPath=null` and run the base model regardless of what the coordinator is told.

### `/train-qa` — conversational Q&A training

New REPL command in `lora` mode for training single-fact associations:

```
you > /train-qa What is my name? A: Dima
  Question: What is my name?
  Answer  : Dima

  Formatted as 4 Q&A pairs  ·  model type: tinyllama
  Training  rank=8 · lr=1.0E-4 · 40 steps ...
  ✔ done  loss=▼ 1.53 (−0.83)
```

The command auto-generates 4 phrasings of the question (exact, `Can you tell me: ...`, `Please answer: ...`, plus one repeat) to improve generalization. The chat template appropriate for the model type (detected from the model path) is applied to each pair. Flags `--lora-steps-qa N` and `--lora-early-stop F` control training depth.

Separator syntax: `Q: <question> A: <answer>` or `<question> A: <answer>`.

### Diagnostic tracing (`--verbose`)

All tracing is prefixed `[TRACE]` for easy grep. Added to:

| Location | What is shown |
|----------|---------------|
| LoRA REPL startup | Model type (chat template key), model path, all LoRA hyperparameters |
| `/train-qa` | Exact formatted training text with `↵` for newlines, token count, token IDs (verbose only) |
| Per training step (verbose) | `step=N loss=F chunk=M/T ms=D` |
| Cluster inference (verbose) | Chat template key used for each inference request |
| `juno-deploy.sh` bootstrap | Per-node params baked into user-data script |
| `juno-deploy.sh` SCP | Local source, remote target, per-node `node.env` patch |
| `juno-deploy.sh` coordinator env | Full `cluster-nodes.env` contents echoed after write |

### AWS deploy hardening (`juno-deploy.sh`)

Multiple bugs fixed during end-to-end AWS validation:

**Double base64 encoding (cloud-init rejected user-data).** `--user-data` was passed as a pre-base64-encoded string. AWS CLI base64-encodes it again; cloud-init received double-encoded garbage and logged `Unhandled non-multipart (text/x-not-multipart) userdata`. Fix: write user-data to a temp file and pass `file:///tmp/juno-userdata-*.sh` — the CLI reads it raw and does single encoding. The `[TRACE]` size line now also prints `first-line: #!/bin/bash` so shebang presence is visible in the setup log.

**TRACE logs contaminating user-data.** `_build_node_userdata` is called as `USER_DATA=$(_build_node_userdata ...)` which captures all stdout. The four `log` / `[TRACE]` calls inside the function were writing to stdout, prepending ANSI escape codes before `#!/bin/bash`. Cloud-init saw no shebang on line 1 and skipped execution. Fix: all `log` calls inside `_build_node_userdata` now redirect to stderr with `>&2`.

**Relative `--lora-play` path not resolved.** When called from `scripts/aws/`, a path like `../models/model.lora` resolves to `scripts/models/model.lora` (which doesn't exist). `_scp_lora_to_nodes` hit the `[[ ! -f ]]` guard and returned silently, leaving `node.env` with empty `JUNO_LORA_PLAY_PATH`. Fix: `--lora-play` is resolved to absolute path at parse time via `realpath`. `setup()` also validates the file exists before any AWS spend.

**Race condition: coordinator started before node restart completed.** `_scp_lora_to_nodes` previously used `systemctl restart --no-block` and polled `systemctl is-active` to detect readiness. The old instance remained `active` during shutdown so the poll returned immediately, `_write_cluster_env_and_start_coordinator` ran, and the coordinator sent `loadShard` to the old (no-LoRA) instance. The restarted instance came up 19 minutes later, too late. Fix: synchronous stop → patch → start per node: `systemctl stop juno-node` (synchronous, waits for JVM exit), `sed` patch of `node.env`, `systemctl start juno-node` (synchronous, returns once gRPC port is bound, ~2s). Coordinator only starts after all three nodes have confirmed `active` status with correct env.

**Local relative path baked verbatim into `cluster-nodes.env`.** Even when SCP succeeded, the coordinator received `JUNO_LORA_PLAY_PATH=../models/...` (the pre-`realpath` value), causing `model load failed: ../models/...` on the nodes. Fix: `_scp_lora_to_nodes` updates the global `LORA_PLAY_PATH` to the remote absolute path (`/opt/juno/models/<basename>`) before returning, so `_write_cluster_env_and_start_coordinator` writes the correct value.

**`_write_cluster_env_and_start_coordinator` missing closing brace.** The `}` was accidentally elided, causing `scan_regions()` to be parsed as part of the function body.

**End-to-end verification:**

Confirmed working on 3 × m7i-flex.large AWS cluster (eu-north-1) with TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q4_K_M and a `.lora` adapter trained locally, SCPed and deployed via `juno-deploy.sh setup --lora-play`.
